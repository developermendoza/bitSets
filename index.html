    <h1>BitSets</h1>
    <p>
      A BitSet, short for "bit set" is a fixed-sized collection of bits, where
      each bit can in one of two states:0 or 1. Bitsets are commonly used to
      represent a set of unique elements or to perform bitwise operations
      efficiently. They are particularly useful when dealing with a large number
      of binary flags or when memory efficiency is crucial.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some key points about bitsets:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Compact Representation:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bitsets are space-efficient because each bit represents a binary
          state, allowing you to pack multiple flags into a single integer or
          array of integers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Set Operations:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bitsets support set operations like intersection, union, and
          difference, which can be performed efficiently using bitwise
          operations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Fast Membership Tests:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Checking whether a specific element is in the set is fast, as involves
          a simple bitwise AND operation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Memory Efficiency:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Compared to traditional set implementations using arrays or linked
          structures, bitsets can be more memory-efficient, especially when
          dealing with a large number or elements.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
